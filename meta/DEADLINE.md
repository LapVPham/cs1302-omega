## Part 1: App Description

It is a game of tetris, a simple game using blocks by implementing arrays
    and different javafx functions to make an interactive game.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

The most exciting thing for me with coding is able to make something from sctratch,
    into an application or function that able to capture audience with it. I was able
    to learn so much more through tutorials and research on other works and implement
    them onto my own.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

I would look into how to make certain code into a method and shorten them
    instead of stuffing them into the main class and run straight from there.
    As a beginner I still makes mistakes like instead of calling or make pane
    windows in different class, I call and use it on the spot in main class.
